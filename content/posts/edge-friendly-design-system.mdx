I stopped chasing pixel-perfect component libraries for every project. Instead I ship:

- **Tokens** for colors, spacing, and radii.
- **Utility-first styling** with Tailwind so I can tweak layouts inside MDX.
- **One surface** per screen: hero, body, or footnotes—never all three fighting for attention.

It keeps bundle sizes lean and still leaves room for custom art direction when a story needs it.
