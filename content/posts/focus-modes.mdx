summary: 'Focus mode is less about hiding UI and more about guiding momentum. This layout keeps the navigation out of the scroll path.'

Focus modes are not about isolation; they are about intent. I structure reading flows like this:

### 1. Remove the wobble
If an element vibrates or slides in, it better have a reason. Subtle fades > kinetic chaos.

### 2. Sequenced typography
Headings signpost, body copy narrates, callouts invite action. Mixing those roles breaks flow.

### 3. Peripheral navigation
The sidebar stays accessible but out of the main scroll path so reading momentum never stalls.
