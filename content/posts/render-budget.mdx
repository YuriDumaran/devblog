Most Lighthouse regressions I see on side projects come from enthusiasm, not neglect. A few constraints keep me honest:

1. Two font files total—regular and bold. Display typefaces are a luxury.
2. Ship SVGs or CSS gradients before reaching for PNGs.
3. Let browsers cache aggressively; fingerprint everything.

When the page weighs less, storytelling feels faster.
