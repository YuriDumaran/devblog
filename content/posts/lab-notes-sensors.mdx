I built a tiny bridge between particulate sensors and narrative pacing. When the studio air shifts, the UI nudges the story:

```js
const quality = getAirQuality();
if (quality === 'stale') {
  timeline.push({ type: 'break', note: 'Open the windows.' });
}
```

It is whimsical, but it keeps me aware of the space I build in.
