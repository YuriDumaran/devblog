Shipping from a locked-down laptop means the toolchain has to live inside containers.

1. The Docker image mirrors production as closely as possible, so `docker compose up` doubles as my integration test.
2. Firebase Hosting takes static exports without any drama, which keeps deploys measurable in seconds.
3. GitHub Actions runs the same container to publish previews when I push to `dev`.

The result: I spend zero cycles babysitting environments. Everything is declarative, checked into git, and rebuildable on a whim.
